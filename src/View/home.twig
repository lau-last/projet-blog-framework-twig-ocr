        <p class="mt-5">I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.
            Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be
            some
            sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may beâ€¦ I've got to
            find
            a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every
            three
            hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
            Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter,
            because
            I'm involved. Leela's gonna kill me. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>
